# Auto FxTwitter

A simple Chrome extension that seamlessly converts `twitter.com`/`x.com` to `fxtwitter.com`/`fixupx.com` when copying links via the share button. Useful when you want to share the post with preview (e.g. on Discord).

> [!IMPORTANT]
This extension only works by clicking the share button.  
It does not convert links when you copy it from the address bar manually, as it is a limitation of browser extensions for security reasons.
